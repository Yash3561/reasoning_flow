    "[1] If a primary alcohol is oxidized under these conditions, an aldehyde forms.",
    "[2] If an aldehyde is exposed to excess oxidant, a carboxylic acid results.",
    "[3] For any species x, if x is a Lewis acid, then x accepts an electron pair from a Lewis base.",
    "[4] Aluminum chloride (AlCl3) is a Lewis acid.",
    "[5] A primary alcohol in the sample is subjected to these oxidizing conditions.",
    "[6] Therefore an aldehyde forms from the primary alcohol (from [1] and [5]).",
    "[7] Therefore a carboxylic acid forms from that aldehyde (from [2] and [6]).",
    "[8] Therefore AlCl3 accepts an electron pair from a Lewis base (from [3] and [4]).",
    "[9] Consequently, a carboxylic acid is obtained and AlCl3 accepts an electron pair (from [7] and [8])."
