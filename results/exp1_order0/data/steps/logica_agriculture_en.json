    "[3] For every field x, if x has soil pH below 5.5, then x requires liming.",
    "[4] Field Alpha has soil pH below 5.5.",
    "[5] We apply nitrogen fertilizer.",
    "[6] Therefore leaf chlorophyll increases.",
    "[7] Therefore grain yield rises.",
    "[8] Therefore Field Alpha requires liming.",
    "[9] Thus grain yield rises and Field Alpha requires liming."
